Astatine is element number 85 and is the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust. It is highly radioactive and has never been observed in its pure form becuase it would immediately vaporize by the heat of its own radioactivity. It is considered a metalloid. astatine-210, the most stable astatine isotope, has a half-life of 8.1 hours.
